# Lane Detection with Computer Vision

This Python script utilizes computer vision techniques, including color selection, Kalman filtering, and Hough transform, to detect and visualize lanes in road scenes. The project leverages image processing and analysis to enhance the understanding of road structures.

## Features

- Lane detection using color selection techniques.
- Kalman filtering for smooth and accurate lane tracking.
- Hough transform for identifying and visualizing lane lines.
- Works with road scene images for real-world applicability.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV library

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install opencv-python`
2. Run the script: `python lane_detection.py`
3. Provide road scene images for lane detection analysis.

## How it Works

- Color Selection: Identify lane colors in road scene images.
- Kalman Filtering: Smooth and predict lane positions over consecutive frames.
- Hough Transform: Detect lane lines and visualize them in the image.
